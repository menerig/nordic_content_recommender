# Nordic Content Recommendation Engine (Hybrid, Explainable)

A hybrid recommendation system designed to surface **personalized content for Nordic and Scandinavian audiences**, combining collaborative filtering, content-based embeddings, and explainable ranking.

This project demonstrates how data science can support **content discovery, audience engagement, and retention** for streaming and media platforms operating in the Nordic region.

## 🎯 Motivation

Most recommender systems struggle with:
- culturally specific niches (e.g. Nordic noir, Swedish comedy)
- multilingual audiences (Swedish / English / Nordic languages)
- cold-start titles with limited interaction data

This project explores a **hybrid approach** that blends:
- user behavior (implicit feedback)
- semantic understanding of content (text embeddings)
- regional and cultural metadata

The result is a system that can recommend *why* something fits a viewer — not just *what* to watch.
